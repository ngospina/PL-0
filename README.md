# PL/0
**PL/0** is a programming language intended as an educational language similar to, but simpler than, **Pascal** (a general-purpose programming language). The language was introduced, along with a Compiler-Interpreter system, in the book *Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs* by *Niklaus Wirth* (1976).
