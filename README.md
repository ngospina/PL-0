# PL/0
**PL/0** is a programming language intended as an educational language similar to, but simpler than, **Pascal** (a general-purpose programming language). The language was introduced, along with a Compiler-Interpreter system written in **CDC Pascal**, in the book *Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs* by *Niklaus Wirth* (1976).

The **PL/0** language was extended with input/output operators, comments, and a Compiler-Interpreter written in **Lilith Modula-2**, in the book *Compilerbau* by *Niklaus Wirth* (1986).
